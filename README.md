# Image-Encryption-And-Decryption-using-AES-Algorithm
These days, we use devices such as computers, mobile phones, and many other devices for communication, as well as for storing and transmitting data. As a result, the number of users has increased. Additionally, there is an increase in the number of unauthorized users who attempt to access data by unfair means. This raises the problem of data security. Images are sent over an insecure transmission channel from different sources. Certain image data contains secret information, and some images themselves are highly confidential, making their protection essential. To solve this problem, we use the AES algorithm to encrypt and decrypt images. This encrypted data is unreadable to unauthorized users. This encrypted data can be sent over the network and can be decrypted using AES at the receiving end. Therefore, the transmission is protected.
